Logistics Planning Tool
I would like to see if I can get the Marine Corps away from using spreadsheets to determine logistics requirements to a web-based application. I have no programing experience but 17+ years of working in logistics. The Marine Corps has thousands of logisticians that waste countless hours computing fuel, food, water, transportation capacities, etc every time a unit moves. The computations are basic math problems based upon the number of people in a unit, the equipment set they rate, the distance they are moving, and the environment (ie desert, jungle, temperate, etc) in which they are working in. I'll attach the most detailed spreadsheet that I've ever seen developed. I don't think this is easy and don't know where to start, but everything that I've read is that if it can be done then this is the place.
